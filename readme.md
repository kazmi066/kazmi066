I’ve been around the frontend long enough to know the value of good HTML, solid CSS, and clean JS. My focus is on accessibility, performance, and resilience, things that actually make the web work for everyone.

I care more about fundamentals than chasing trends. Semantic markup, responsive layouts, UI that feels right in the browser. Frameworks are part of the modern world, so I use them when needed—but I don’t forget the base concepts they all stand on.

I’ve built and maintained component systems, worked closely with designers, and made sure back-end folks get clean hooks into the UI. Still enjoy crafting the surface layer of the web, the part real people actually touch.
